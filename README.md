# easy_purchase
online shop for online purchases
 so the bot is basically just to assist customers purchase their products, responde to customer complaints and also help track their products information.
 the customers have two options of browsing good, they can choose to browse the procuts on my main channel or they can choose to use the bot by searching
 for the products their looking and if available would be displayed by the bot and if not would just be notified the pproduct does not exist.

I will also need your help in the administring the database into the bot and connect it to the channel so they can both fetch and track products.
